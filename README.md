# GTFS2GMNS
 
[The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)](https://gtfs.org/) defines a common format for public transportation schedules and associated geographic information. It is used by thousands of public transport providers. As a data conversion tool, gtfs2gmns, can directly convert the GTFS data to node, link, and agent files in the [GMNS](https://github.com/zephyr-data-specs/GMNS) format.

Take the Phoenix network as an example. You can visualize generated networks using [NeXTA](https://github.com/xzhou99/NeXTA-GMNS) or [QGis](https://qgis.org/en/site/).
